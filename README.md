# COSMO Metadynamics workshop

This is a simple tutorial prepared during the Covid19 quarantine for the COSMO research group.
It was constructed as a in person tutorial/lectures, and may be quite hard to follow by reading through it.

The slides are in the slides/ folder contained in a jupyter notebook file, while the exercises are in the /exercises folder.
